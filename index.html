        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Saeed, an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly online experiences. As an entry-level web developer, I have gained a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have recently started exploring React as well.

My journey in web development began during my university studies, where I pursued a degree in Cyber Security. While studying Cyber Security, I developed a strong interest in web technologies and decided to expand my skill set into the world of web development.
Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on numerous projects where I utilized my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to build responsive and visually appealing websites. I have a keen eye for detail and enjoy crafting intuitive user interfaces that provide seamless navigation and enjoyable experiences for users.
In addition to my core web development skills, I have also gained some experience in React. This modern JavaScript library has allowed me to create dynamic and interactive web applications. I have enjoyed exploring React and leveraging its powerful components to build efficient and scalable web solutions.
My background in Cyber Security provides me with a unique perspective when it comes to web development. It has ingrained in me a strong understanding of security best practices and the importance of maintaining data integrity and user privacy. I believe this knowledge sets me apart and enables me to develop websites that prioritize security and protect users' sensitive information.
As an entry-level web developer, I am enthusiastic about learning and growing in this ever-evolving field. I am eager to contribute my skills, creativity, and dedication to a dynamic team where I can continue to expand my knowledge and contribute to impactful web development projects.
I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with talented professionals in the industry and contribute to the success of innovative web solutions.

          <h3>speed typing game</h3>
          <p>I created a speed typing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can test and improve your typing skills by accurately and quickly typing the displayed text. The game provides instant feedback on accuracy and includes a timer to track your typing speed. At the end, you receive a score based on accuracy and speed. It's a fun way to challenge yourself and become a better typist.</p>
